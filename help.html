      <h2 class="mb-3">How IPTV Detective works — simple explanation</h2>
      <p>This site helps you check an IPTV provider's channel list and compare it with other public submissions to find identical or very similar packages. It's useful for spotting resellers (different shops selling the same package) and comparing prices.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-3">How it works (brief)</h4>
      <p>IPTV Detective analyzes a provider's playlist and compares it to public submissions to identify identical or highly similar packages — useful for spotting resellers and finding better prices.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-3">Fetch &amp; analyze in-browser</h5>
      <p>The primary workflow now uses Xtream/portal credentials: when you enter valid Xtream fields the browser fetches the playlist directly from the panel (using the player API endpoints) and parses it locally. This avoids uploading full playlists to the server for most checks. (The previous provider-URL input has been removed from the main page. The primary workflow requires Xtream credentials; test/debug flows exist only for development and do not provide full analysis.)</p>

      <h5 class="mt-3">What is sent to the server</h5>
      <p>Only small numeric metrics (counts) are sent to the server for comparison. Your Xtream credentials are used in-memory by your browser for the fetch and are <strong>never stored</strong> or written to disk on the server. Submissions may include optional metadata or links for admin review, but credentials will not be saved with submissions.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-3">Comparison</h5>
      <p>The server compares submissions using available metrics (live streams, live categories, series, series categories, VOD categories) and/or legacy channel/group counts. The system prefers structured metrics when present and falls back to channel/group counts for older databases.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-3">What we show</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counts &amp; summary</strong> — numbers of streams, categories and VOD counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Similarity score</strong> — a single percentage combining multiple metrics to indicate how close two packages are.</li>
        <li><strong>Matched providers</strong> — candidates with high similarity and a short summary including price comparison.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-3">Privacy &amp; storage</h4>
      <p>By default the playlist is parsed in your browser and only small summaries are uploaded. The server does not receive your plain-text Xtream password during the check flow. If you choose to "submit" a provider for the public database, that submission may be stored (including optional raw links or credentials if provided) — submissions are visible to admins and may be displayed publicly depending on site settings.</p>

      <div class="alert alert-warning mt-3" role="alert">
        <strong>Why we ask for Xtream credentials</strong>
        <p class="mb-0">We only request Xtream/portal credentials so the site can fetch the provider's playlist and calculate channel/group counts and other small metrics needed to compare packages. These credentials are used in-memory for that single request and are never stored on disk or saved in the database.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 mt-2"><strong>Concerned about privacy?</strong> If you don't want to provide live account credentials, create a temporary/trial IPTV account or use a provider URL that doesn't expose your real login — that will give the same comparison results without risking your primary credentials.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-3">Tips</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>For the primary flow, use the Xtream credentials fields (host, optional port, username, password) — the site fetches and parses the playlist in your browser.</li>
        <li>Large playlists take longer to fetch — if a fetch fails, try again or use the test/debug flows (these are limited and intended for development only).</li>
        <li>Do not paste credentials into any URL fields; use the dedicated Xtream fields.</li>
        <li>Refreshing the page may be required if site verification (anti-bot) appears.</li>
      </ul>
